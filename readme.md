# Introduction
  Troll your friends using this! Let's see what happens! (There is endings thingy so I don't think you would keep them to troll, right?)
# How it works
  Look at how it works here!
  - 1st: It acts as your system is corrupted at (random percent) from 51, then it will be like "you must write a code here to proceed with corruptions being wiped from ya system."
  - 2nd: If you don't type a code, a BSOD will appear.
